<h1>Flappy Bird Clone in Java </h1>
<hr>
This project is a simple recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game built using Java and Swing for GUI development. It demonstrates core programming concepts such as object-oriented design, game loops, event handling, and collision detection.

<h2>Features</h2>
Smooth Gameplay: The game features smooth animations and realistic gravity effects. <br>
Custom Graphics: Includes background, bird, and pipe images for a visually engaging experience.<br>
Score Tracking: Displays the score during gameplay and at the end of the game.<br>
Collision Detection: Detects when the bird hits pipes or falls out of bounds, triggering a game-over state. <br>
Replay Option: Press the spacebar after a game over to restart the game. <br>

<h3>How to Play</h3>

Run the program. <br>
Use the spacebar to make the bird "flap" and gain altitude.<br>
Avoid the pipes by navigating through the gaps.<br>
The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or falls off the screen.<br>
Press spacebar again after a game-over to restart.<br>


<h4> Tools and Libraries </h4>
Java Swing: For GUI components and rendering. <br>
Java Timer: Used to manage game loops and pipe placement intervals.<br>

<h3> Requirements</h3>
JDK 8 or higher. <br>
Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or a command-line environment to run the program. <br>
